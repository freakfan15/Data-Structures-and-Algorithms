-Some Special functions that C++ Classes give you when you create a class/object

1. Constructor
   - that is responsible for creating an object
   - gets called automatically and is called once.
   - same name as class name.
   - Parametrised Constructor:
   	>when u pass some parameters in a constructor.

   	Note: Each object can call only one constructor be it parametrised or default

   	Constructor Overloading:
   	when different constructors are defined with the same name it is called CO. They are differentiated by the the diff parameters that are passed in diff Constructors.

2. Copy Constructor
	-make a copy of an object
	-exists by default

	So when u need to make your own copy constructor?
	-Shallow Copy
	-you have to make your own copy constructor if a deep copy is needed.
	-deep copy is needed if a pointer is pointing to the same mem location for two objects, mainly in case of dynamic mem alloc.

3. Copy Assignment Operator
	-copies when u do assignment
	-Car d=c; //copy constructor
	-Car d;
	 d=c; //copy assignmnet operator\
	-we can write our own copy assignment operator to make a deep copy many times

4. Destructor
   - Clear out the mem occupied by the object
   - automatically when the object goes out of scope.
   - normally no need to write destructors but 
     in case of dynamically declared obejcts we need  to make it explicitly.
